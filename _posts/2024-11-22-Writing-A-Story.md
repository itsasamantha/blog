### INTRODUCTION

Despite being basic components, for myself and a lot of other writers, finding a satisfactory beginning, middle and ending to a short story can be difficult. Especially if the idea just came to you without a full plot being developed. It can also be annoying and sometimes boring to work on the same story for a while. Burnout is expeted to happen and forgetting what made you want to write is common. 

Here I will compile my tips and tricks I have gathered through my noexistent writing career.

To explain I will be _vunarably_ sharing the process of my developing light novel Entropy

### STEP 1 Planning
If you're anything like me you decided you needed to write down a story that just flashed in your mind
Whether you've thought of a new twist for a genre you love, delved through a string of what if's, or you just thought the idea would be cool. 

When this ideas appears in your mind **WRITE IT DOWN**

For me this was the idea of the main character drastically injuring her friend in a school accident.

Now that you've documented your million dollar idea. You have to plan out how you want it to go.

Basics of a story include an: Exposition, Conflict, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action and Resolution.

#### One

To align our idea to these main points we first have to figure out what part our ideas aligns with.

For me, my idea would line up with the Exposition. 

This can be moved around a bit. For my idea it could have also worked as the conflict but after this next step I realised i liked it more as the expositon.

#### Two

Next we make a list that looks like this.
