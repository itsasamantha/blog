# **Getting Stuck At The Airport**


Traveling from place to place should be an easy feat. You buy a ticket to your destination and you buy a ticket back home. Yet there have been many times where thatâ€™s been far from the case for me. From spending an extra day in Dublin to sleeping in an Istanbul airport, traveling has often been a struggle. Yet this was the first time that I really felt like I might be stuck.

For some background information during the summer of 2024 around late august I had been doing quite a lot and had quite a bit more to do. 

At the time I already took a flight to Florida for a family reunion with my cousins. Then after I came back I worked at an elementary school for around six weeks. (WHERE I CAUGHT THE FLU).

So when I heard that suddenly I was heading back to Florida after I worked my last day I was exhausted. So naturally my response was to spend one day in between NOT packing my bag. Instead I (like many others would) decided to play games, rest and other things.

However my flight was supposed to be at 5AM and my mother, who was driving me and my brother to the airport, would leave super early. And knowing this I made the decision to just stay up all night. 

At around 2 or 3 AM I began packing and by packing I mean rushing to get all my clothes and essentials in my bag. Then I accidentally ended up cutting myself right as I was told we were leaving in 15 minutes. Of course I had no bandaids at home so I went to the airport just bleeding out. The trip there was calm, we made our flight and enjoyed our time. 

While we were there I went to the pool, visited a family friend and played a lot of Mario Odyssey. Overall I had a ton of fun.
THE ISSUE

The problem came when it was time to leave. This time I was fully packed before we left and we were able to get to the gate on time and waited for the plane to board.

### **THE FIRST**

This flight was early as well leaving at 6:45 AM. After a majority of the passengers had boarded, My brother and I went up to the counter to ask about seats. 

See we were traveling standby meaning we would only get on the plane if there were extra seats available if someone misses their flight. 

The crew had made It clear that the flight was fully booked. However that wasn't much of a deterrent because out of the people waiting for this flight we were priority being at number 1 and 2. 

Waiting a while longer it was revealed that there was only one free seat left on the flight. Deciding not to split up we declined the seat and made our way over to the next gate.

### **THE SECOND**

The next flight was scheduled to leave at 7:10 AM. We walked over to the airport and repeated our process. We waited until a majority of people boarded the plane then approached the front desk of this gate. 

Once again we were informed that there was only one available seat. Yet there were still some people that were not checked into this flight. After waiting a very long time there were still people who were too late to board. 

In my mind it seemed like this would be the opportunity to get on this flight. This time we were around 5 and 6 on the list. (this part is from memory)
